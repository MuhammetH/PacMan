## Most web pages are built using these three technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here is some explanations and how I am gonna use these in this game.

## what is html

- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
- You write HTML using tags, of which there are many.
- A `<div>` is a generic tag, great for games, not great when you need more specific tags.
  - (For example, the HTML for a blog post should use paragraph tags: `<p>`.)
- Tags are meant to structure and organize your content.
- Your content can be text, images, video, etc.
- You can nest tags inside one another.
  - You might have a paragraph (as a p tag) and an anchor tag (an a tag).
  - In this case, the anchor tag is nested inside of the paragraph tag

## What is CSS

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- The tags you write in your html have to be drawn to the screen.
- For every tag, the browser draws a rectangle.
- You have to tell the browser how to draw the rectangles.
- There are default styles built into the browser, but you can specify custom ones.
- The best way to associate styles with an element on the page? use classes

## Using JavaScript

- A variable is a programming term for a label or an identifier.
  - You need variables so that you can refer to data using a convenient name.
- What is a function?
  - A function is like a recipe, which contains one or more steps.
  - A function can be used over and over again.
  - Usually, a function takes input (called "arguments") and returns output.
- What is an event?
  - As you click, tap, scroll, and type, your browser responds. Each of these interactions is called an event.
  - You can customize how the browser responds by writing functions that handle different kinds of events.

## To do's

- add scrore board.
- make the map complex.
- add profile.
